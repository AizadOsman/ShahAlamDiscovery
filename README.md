<h1>ShahAlamDiscovery App</h1>
<p>This repository contains the project of an Android application called ShahAlamDiscovery app. This application showcases a few interesting places that can be visited in Shah Alam. It integrates <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> to handle user registration and authentication on the app. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/apis-by-platform" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a> was also used to pin the targeted destinations on the map.</p>
